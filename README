Two Eclipse plug-ins which provide editors for Less (http://lesscss.org/).

Requirements (i.e., developed on, not tested on anything else):
 - Eclipse 3.7.1
 - Xtext 2.2.1 with ANTLR stuff

You'll find ZIPs with the Eclipse plug-in JARs in the Downloads
section. Drop the JARs into the 'dropins' (or 'plugins', if that
doesn't work) directory in your Eclipse installation directory and
(re-)start your Eclipse. Some of the ZIPs are self-contained, others
aren't. I'm _not_ keeping the ZIPs really up-to-date with HEAD, so to
live on the bleeding edge: clone, import into a suitable Eclipse and
deploy or run the plug-ins yourself.

An p2 update site will be attended to in the future.

Note that these are very much a work-in-progress. I don't aim to
provide a full implementation of CSS3, but only of the part that's
relevant to Less - in particular, the (extended) selectors.

If you're interested in helping to further develop this, fork at
will. I have some specific ideas on how to go from here, so don't
expect me to always accept a pull request verbatim. To give an idea,
here's a rough TODO list:

- having more unit tests would be a good idea ;-)
- full compliance with CSS3 lexical scanning
- implementation of "generic" CSS3 property values but with expressions
- type system implementation for Less
- implementation of Less imports
- nicer syntax highlighting for both CSS and Less
- evaluation engine for Less (expressions)
- mapping of Less -> CSS (model-2-model transformation)
- builder integration of Less -> CSS, using serialization
